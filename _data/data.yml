    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a software engineer who has experience of over 3 years and 8 months.
      These companies were in the phase of startup/scale-up so we had to do more jobs than our titles requirements.
      I started as a Backend developer at my first Job. Django was my first framework at that time.
      In my second job, there was a challenge with Front-end development with ClojureScript and Back-end development with Ruby on Rails.
      These years taught me some lessons like:
      Caring about %90 test coverage and writing readable code. Able to write
      code according to the separation of concern. Follows DRF design
      philosophies which are Less code, Quick development, Don't
      repeat yourself, Explicit is better than implicit, and Loose coupling.
